            <h2>What are IISERs?</h2>

            <p>
                <strong style="color: #004080;">Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs)</strong> are premier research institutes of India offering research work from the very beginning of the undergraduate degree. These institutes
                are comparable to the Indian Institutes of Technology in terms of education. The key difference is the focus on research â€” IISERs emphasize hands-on research at the undergraduate level.

                To integrate and advance interdisciplinary science education and research, the Indian government established IISERs across India. The seven campuses of IISERs are located in Berhampur, Bhopal, Kolkata, Mohali, Pune, Thiruvananthapuram, and Tirupati. The
                first IISER was established in 2006 and the most recent, in 2016. These campuses continue to attract the brightest young minds in the country.
            </p>

            <p>
                The IISERs have produced a remarkable volume of intellectual output in a short span, including numerous research papers and patents. They provide early exposure to world-class research facilities and offer interdisciplinary opportunities for extended
                research projects, MS theses, and internships starting at the undergraduate level.
